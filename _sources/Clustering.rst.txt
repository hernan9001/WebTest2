Clustering
==========


The module comprises two algorithms for clustering cerebral fibers, HClust (Clustering Hierarchical, :cite:`Claudio-Roman-2017, Claudio-Roman-2022`) y FFClust (Fast Fiber Clustering, :cite:`Andrea-Vazquez-2020`)


HClust Description
------------------


HClust is an average-link hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm which allows finding bundles based on a pairwise fiber distance measure.
The algorithm calculates a distance matrix between all fiber pairs for a bundles dataset (:math:`d_{ij}`), by using the maximum of the Euclidean distance between fiber pairs (Equation [1]).
Then, it computes an affinity graph on the :math:`d_{ij}` matrix for the fiber pairs that have Euclidean distance below a maximum distance threshold (*MaxDistance_Threshold*). 
The Affinity :cite:`ODonnell-2007` is given by the following equation:

.. math::
    \begin{equation}
    a_{ij} = e^{\frac{-d_{ij}}{\sigma^{2}}}
    \end{equation}


where :math:`d_{ij}` is the distance between the elements :math:`i` and :math:`j`, and :math:`\sigma` is a parameter that defines the similarity scale in $mm$.

From the affinity graph, the hierarchical tree is generated using an agglomerative average-link hierarchical clustering algorithm.
The tree is adaptively partitioned using a distance threshold (*PartDistance_Threshold*).

FFClust Description
-------------------


FFClust is an intra-subject clustering algorithm aims to identify compact and homogeneous fiber clusters on a large tractography dataset.
The algorithm consists of four stages. The stage 1 applies Minibatch K-Means clustering on five fiber points, and it merges fibers sharing the same point clusters (map clustering) in stage 2.
Next, it reassigns small clusters to bigger ones (stage 3) considering distance of fibers in direct and reverse order.
Finally, at stage 4, the algorithm groups clusters sharing the central point and merges close clusters represented by their centroids.
The distance among fibers is defined as the maximum of the Euclidean distance between corresponding points.
