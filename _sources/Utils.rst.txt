Utils
=====

The utils are a set of tools used for tractography preprocessing and the analysis of brain fiber clustering and segmentation results.
The module includes tools for reading and writing brain fiber files in *'.bundles'* format, transform the fibers to a reference coordinate system based on a deformation field,
sampling of fibers at n equidistant points, calculation of intersection between sets of brain fibers,
and tools for extracting measures and filtering fiber clusters or segmented bundles.

Deformation
-----------

The *deformation* sub-module transforms a tractography file to another space using a non-linear deformation file. 
The maps must be stored in NIfTI format, where the voxels contain the transformation to be applied to each voxel 3D space location.
*deformation* applies the deformation to the 3D coordinates of the fiber points. 
The *deformation* can be employed on HCP(Human Conectome Project) data during the preprocessing stage before applying the segmentation algorithm.

Sampling
--------


The *sampling* sub-module performs a sampling of the fibers, recalculating their points using a defined number of equidistant points.
The sampling sub-module is used in the preprocessing stage of the segmentation and clustering algorithms.

Intersection
------------ 


The *bundle intersection* sub-module calculates a similarity measure between two sets of brain fibers (fiber clusters or segmented bundles).
It uses a maximum distance threshold to consider two fibers as similar. Both sets of fibers must be in the same space. 
First, a Euclidean distance matrix is calculated between the fibers of the two sets. 
Then, the maximum distance threshold is applied between fiber pairs and the number of fibers from one set that have a similar fibers in the other set are count, for both sets. 
The similarity measure yields a value between *0* and *100%*.

Postprocessing
--------------


The *Postprocessing* sub-module contains a set of algorithms that can be applied on the results of clustering and segmentation algorithms.
This algorithm constructs a `pandas.DataFrame object` , where each key corresponds to the name of the fiber set (cluster or segmented fascicle),
followed by measures defined on the fiber set such as: size (number of fibers), intra-set distance and mean length (in *mm*).
It can be used to perform single or multiple feature filtering on the clustering or segmentation results.
